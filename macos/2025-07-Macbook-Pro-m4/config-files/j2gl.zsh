# Put files in this folder to add your own custom functionality.
# See: https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Customization
#
# Files in the custom/ directory will be:
# - loaded automatically by the init script, in alphabetical order
# - loaded last, after all built-ins in the lib/ directory, to override them
# - ignored by git by default
#
# Example: add custom/shortcuts.zsh for shortcuts to your local projects
#
# brainstormr=~/Projects/development/planetargon/brainstormr
# cd $brainstormr

# MySQL Client
# export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/mysql-client/bin:$PATH"

# GPG
# export GPG_TTY=$(tty)
# gpgconf --launch gpg-agent

# THIS MUST BE AT THE END OF THE FILE FOR SDKMAN TO WORK!!!
