# my-env-configs

My custom environment configurations for each system like

* .bash_profile
* .bash_rc
* .gitconfig

## Notes
* brew installation.  See: http://brew.sh/
```bash
$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```
* For brew completion need to run:
```bash
$ brew install bash-completion
```
